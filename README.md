# Lesson10

This project contains an assignment from the Java class (Java Programming II: Core Java Programming) that I'm taking through the Extension at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). The primary objective of the assignment is to introduce us to Test-Driven Development (TDD), and the JUnit platform.
